# SQJoke
***SQJoke*** (aka _**Superquark** Joke_) refers to the namesake and well-known italian TV programme on cultural divulgation.

It reproduces the solemn [Orchestral suites of Johann Sebastian Bach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_on_the_G_String), which is the theme song of this TV programme.

### AYFKM? What it does?
As already said, this stupid app simply reproduces that song.

## Usage
The right question is *when* to use this app:

* When that rambling friend who talks shit arrives, but you want to prove you are stupider than him and you have to prove it while speaking over him accompained by this soundtrack
* If you are [Piero Angela](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piero_Angela), [Alberto Angela](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberto_Angela) or you want to appear cool like them
* To solemnify that absolutely crucial speech

Other uses of this app are unknown, but it's absolutelly necessary when you're reading "fuffa-documents" a.k.a SalvatoreAranzulla-like unuseful posts ([example](https://whilefalsedonothing.wordpress.com/2016/04/24/accurata-descrizione-delle-guide-informatiche-scritte-da-incompetenti/#esempio-esplicativo)).

Sorry if some of these examples can't be explained to non-italian people.

## Hacking
This app is made with Android Studio (2.1) and a lot of time wasted trying to understand how google's programmers think.
